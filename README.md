# AUTOMATIC-MODULATION-CLASSIFICATION
RUBUST DEEP LEARNING-BASED ALGORITHM FOR AUTOMATIC MODULATION CLASSIFICATION
Automatic modulation classification (AMC) is a preliminary autonomous process of signal demodulation in the physical layer, which plays a crucial role in both civilian and military applications. Nowadays, deep learning (DL) is a fundamental technology for radio frequency (RF) signal analysis and has demonstrated excellent performance in AMC applications. Various standard modulation datasets have been released for deep learning technology, including RADIOML 2016.10a and RadioML 2018.01a, which can be used for original and reproducible experimentation and comparison. The primary objective of this project is to study a novel DL-based classification framework to achieve improved AMC performance. Additionally, several state-of-the-art AMC classification algorithms can be selected as benchmarks for comparison purposes.
